Reading Documentation
Regardless if it's an API or another coding language, if it's a good resource it will have docs/documentation.

Good Doc Will Have:
How to use their lang/API
Examples of data/use
Routes of API listed
Explanations and maybe even tutorials (usually in a section titled "Getting Started")
Been written in an easy to read way
An organized format (nav menus, labels, etc.)
There will usually be a button or link that is label "Docs" or "Documentation" so you can easily see how they would like you to use their API/Lang.

Things to Note:
Take your time with the documentation, it all seems like gibberish when we are starting to code/care about what data we get back. Looking for keywords like "JSON", "routes", or words pertaining to what you wish to use from the API will lead you in the right direction.

If it's rough to sort through: know you aren't the first to use the API.

Google to see if any tutorials use the API
See if the API links to example projects
Link the API to a group DM with Ben and Kate (we know by looking which will be more complicated to work with)
"6 hours of debugging can save you 5 minutes of reading the documentation."

^ Don't do that

A big part of our future careers of devs is working with things we may not actually have experience in. Pulling up the documentation and using it to construct what you need is a BIG part of dev work. Not using the docs only makes your job more difficult, time consuming, error filled, and frustrating.
